Backend coding exercise
=======================

You will need Node.js 16 (or more recent), which you can download at https://nodejs.org. Run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This should open http://localhost:3000 in your browser, with has the instructions.

When you are happy with your solution, run:

```sh
npm run archive
```
